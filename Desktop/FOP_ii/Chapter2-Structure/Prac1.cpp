/*
 [structure Declaration, Definition, initialization and accessing elements]
 A phone number, such as (212) 767-8900, can be thought of as having three parts:
 the area code (212), the exchange (767), and the number (8900). Write a program
 that uses a structure to store these three parts of a phone number separately. Call
 the structure phone.
 ïƒ¼ Create two structure variables of type phone. Initialize one, and have the
 user input a number for the other one. Then display both numbers.
