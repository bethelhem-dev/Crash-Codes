        secondary education for grades 9-12 in Benishangul Gumuz Region,

        international best practice. The school provides a fully-funded 4-year
        secondary education and boarding experience to female students. Our
        small class sizes, well-resourced facilities, dedicated team of
        educators, and small volunteer base accelerate student learning and the
        development of English and life skills. They also boost career prospects
        while building confidence, creativity, and critical thinking skills.

      Pharo School Homosha was established in 2018 and officially inaugurated on
      February 29, 2020 on 16 hectares of land as a state-of-the-art full board
      girls’ school, with a capacity of 240. The school aims to offer the best
      educational and boarding opportunities to bright and driven girls from
      across the region. Our focus on female education is in recognition of the
      challenges that girls encounter in accessing education, which prevent many
      from unlocking their full potential.
